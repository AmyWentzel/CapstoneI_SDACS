# Hello World Example

Starts a FreeRTOS task to print "Hello World".

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

## How to use example

Follow detailed instructions provided specifically for this example.

Select the instructions depending on Espressif chip installed on your development board:

- [ESP32 Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/get-started/index.html)
- [ESP32-S2 Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s2/get-started/index.html)


## Example folder contents

The project **hello_world** contains one source file in C language [hello_world_main.c](main/hello_world_main.c). The file is located in folder [main](main).

ESP-IDF projects are built using CMake. The project build configuration is contained in `CMakeLists.txt` files that provide set of directives and instructions describing the project's source files and targets (executable, library, or both).

Below is short explanation of remaining files in the project folder.

```
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── pytest_hello_world.py      Python script used for automated testing
├── main
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   └── hello_world_main.c
└── README.md                  This is the file you are currently reading
```

For more information on structure and contents of ESP-IDF projects, please refer to Section [Build System](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/build-system.html) of the ESP-IDF Programming Guide.

## Troubleshooting

* Program upload failure

    * Hardware connection is not correct: run `idf.py -p PORT monitor`, and reboot your board to see if there are any output logs.
    * The baud rate for downloading is too high: lower your baud rate in the `menuconfig` menu, and try again.

## SDACS BLE Node Awareness

On boot, each ESP32-S3 node loads config/NVS defaults, then runs a short BLE
node-awareness advertisement before Wi-Fi and MQTT start. The BLE local name is
`SDACS-<node_id>`, for example `SDACS-node01`, and the advertisement is
non-connectable. The RPi5 gateway scans these advertisements and RSSI values,
then publishes topology updates such as `sdacs/site/topology` and node presence
topics over MQTT.

After `SDACS_BLE_LOCATOR_DURATION_MS`, the node stops advertising, shuts down
NimBLE, and starts the normal SDACS Wi-Fi/MQTT sensing path. The node continues
to publish heartbeat, battery, temp/humidity, audio, and feature topics under
`sdacs/node/<node_id>/...`, and subscribes to its node command topic plus
`sdacs/group/all/cmd`.

Node-RED can trigger `scan_now` on the RPi5 gateway. The ESP32 nodes do not scan
for BLE devices and do not receive commands over BLE.
